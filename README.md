# Diseases_rates_project
This program is made to show the people the information about the death rates of the main diseases. It also can predict the development of that illnesses on the short period of time.
The data, that the program was taken from the API of the American Center of deaseases control and prevention, mostly the xml data which contains useful rates for the deaseases.
After the processing user gets the prediction for the couple of the next years for that rates, also data is organized in the suitable way fro the user, the program can vizualize data by building graphic. Also there are some additional features, that you willbe able to see using the program.
The main.py module contains the main program, which user can run. The files, names of which starts with 'example' represent the work of the parts of the program. Other modules represent the parts of the program as abstract class or predicting module(they all have documentation, so I will not detalize).

There are instructions how to maintain with the program:
1. import libraries that are speciied in the requirements doc.
2. You can familiarize with the main parts of the program by reading the sphinx documentation in the html file.
3. Use the program by running the main.py module. The program will introduce you the commands that you will be able to type, so it will be simple to use it.

The examples represents working with abstract class and with the API information.
